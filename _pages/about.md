I am Alina Stepina, and I am Robotic specialist and C++ developer. 
As a developer, I am constantly experimenting with different approaches to make robotic programs fast and reliable, and I share my findings and experiences through this blog.

Through my blog, I aim to explore various aspects of robotics and showcase how C++ can be utilized to create efficient and robust programs. I share my insights on different topics ranging from algorithms and data structures to programming concepts and design patterns. I also discuss my experiences working with different robotic platforms and tools.
